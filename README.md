# Unemployment Data Analysis

This project analyzes unemployment data to identify trends, patterns, and key factors affecting unemployment rates. The analysis is performed in a Jupyter Notebook (`unemp.ipynb`) using Python's data science libraries.

---

## 📌 Project Overview
The goal of this project is to:
- Load and explore unemployment datasets.
- Clean and preprocess the data.
- Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA).
- Visualize trends in unemployment over time and across regions.
- Identify correlations between unemployment and other socio-economic factors.

## 📂 Dataset
- **Source:** [Add your dataset source here — e.g., Kaggle, government website]
- **Key Columns:**
  - `Date` — Time period of the record
  - `Region` — Geographical location
  - `Unemployment Rate` — Percentage of unemployed individuals
  - Other socio-economic indicators (if present)

## ⚙️ Installation
Clone the repository and install the dependencies:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/unemployment-analysis.git
cd unemployment-analysis
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

🚀 Usage

Open the Jupyter Notebook:

jupyter notebook unemp.ipynb


Run the cells to:

Load the dataset.

Perform EDA.

Generate plots and insights.

📊 Analysis Steps

Data Loading: Import the unemployment dataset using pandas.

Data Cleaning: Handle missing values, fix date formats, and standardize column names.

Exploratory Data Analysis:

Trend analysis over time

Regional comparisons

Seasonal patterns (monthly, quarterly)

Visualization: Use matplotlib and seaborn for:

Line plots of unemployment trends

Heatmaps for correlation analysis

Bar charts for regional unemployment rates

📈 Results

Key Findings:

[Example] Unemployment rates peaked during 2020 due to the pandemic.

[Example] Certain regions consistently show higher unemployment rates.

Visual Insights:
Plots clearly show seasonal variations and long-term trends.

🔮 Future Work

Build predictive models to forecast unemployment rates.

Add more socio-economic indicators for deeper analysis.

Automate data fetching and updates.
